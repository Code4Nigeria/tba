        				Although the women tell glowing tales of their TBA encounters, and others justify their visits to them, there are some others who tell a different story.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Madam Jane, a mother of three in Maraba, a suburb near the FCT, recalled her ordeal in the hands of the TBA and vowed never to visit any again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       "My first labour started very late in the night, and because my husband does not have a car, and considering the high charges in the private clinic in the neighbourhood, my husband took me to the TBA, I nearly lost my life following the complications that arose, and instead of telling us the truth, the old birth attendant kept us in her house for three days and I was suffering seriously. I nearly died," Jane said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       Another woman, Ada said she almost died patronizing a TBA thinking hospitals were expensive. "We had just moved into Abuja from Imo State and considering the high cost of things in Abuja, I went to a popular TBA near my house thinking I was cutting cost, not knowing that I was digging my own grave."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "My husband is a policeman and we didn't have enough money for me to travel to the village to enable my mother attend to me, so I registered with this woman near my house. I am lucky to be alive today. The hygienic situation in her home is not good, and she was patching me up with any cloth she could lay her hands on when I started bleeding," Ada added.
