        				Another drawback for many mothers is that "staff who work in the health centers usually close at 4pm," Lawal Ibrahim said. In some places, they close earlier, he added.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Explaining further he said: "There are times when our wives go into labour after such hours. We take them on motorcycles or carts to the nearest hospital, which is usually no less than a 45minute bike ride, and at least one hour thirty minutes by bicycle," the Ibwa II resident said.
                    </p>

                        In the 10 kilometer perimeter of the railway community, Issa in Kagarko Local Government Area of Kaduna State, there were no health facilities in site beyond a grossly under-equipped patent medicine store at the top of the road leading into the community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       Therefore, in case of an emergency or labour at night, "we are at the mercy of our husbands' motorcycles or bicycles, and sometimes even donkeys" said, Maimuna Jafaru.

                    <p>
                        "It is a lot easier to access the TBAs because they are in the community with us. They have had this training all their lives, so even when you knock on their doors at midnight, it is with excitement that they welcome you. There is no waste of time or ceremony, as they immediately get to work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hajiya Hadiza Adamu ,a TBA in the community said, "we know the pregnant women and when we see their stomachs and when they start dropping, we know those who will soon be knocking on our doors."

                        She showed off her clay pots, dried herbs and other appliances with which she works, adding "the fresh materials we need, we can easily source for from the nearby bushes or get from our neighbours."
