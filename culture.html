        				Zaria's Hauwa'u Al-Amin, a mother of four, who got married just as she became a teenager, was delivered of all her children by a highly revered near 
                        seventy year-old TBA. Al-Amin explains that her upbringing has taught her that it is a taboo for a male to touch a woman who is not his wife or sister, 
                        and since delivery involves a lot of body contact, she would prefer to employ the services of traditional birth attendants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As with many parts of Nigeria, women are sent to their mothers or mothers-in-law for their deliveries, especially when it is their first. 
                        In rural communities where this usually occurs, mothers ensure that their daughters get the best care from TBAs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The women also add that TBAs give them a variety of delivery positions as the Sokoto report stated. "In hospitals women lie on their backs to give birth. 
                        Opening our legs is not ideal when we can squat in the traditional homes and not expose our privates so much."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A group of three elderly women in their late 60s to early 70s, said they have practiced as TBAs for the last 30 years, 
                        and explained the delivery process through an interpreter, in Ibwa. "When labor comes we rub the stomach in circular motions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "When we see that the baby is ready to come out, we get a piece of cloth and put it beneath the woman's anus. 
                        The woman squats and we continue the circular motions and add a gentle massage, until the baby comes out," they said.

                        The belief is that if the women don't give birth in a squatting position, 'the baby will not come out successfully.'
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although a Christian, Blessing Chechet who was born and raised in the community and is now having her own children, told our reporters : 
                        "I also don't give birth lying down. It's a lot easier in the squatting position and less embarrassing too."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's better now because we have a primary healthcare centre in the community, said Musa. In the past if any woman delivered in a hospital, 
                        her peers and even her in-laws (especially the women) would call her weak. To prove their strength, women outdid themselves by ensuring only a TBA attended to them.
