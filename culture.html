        				The issue of traditional birth attendants is one that has hounded Orthodox medicine across Nigeria including the north. Our reporters examine the practice 
        				and the reasons why it is still very popular today in Northern Nigeria.

						At 15, Hajara was already married and began having children a year later. Now 32, she has had five children all of whom were delivered by a traditional 
						birth attendant (TBA) resident in her Ibwa village in Gwagwalada Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).

						Like her, so many other women in the community and beyond, as well as in other States in northern Nigeria do not deliver their children in hospitals.

						This situation which is becoming worrisome features prominently in a recent report released by the United States Agency for International Development 
						(USAID). The report noted that ninety five percent of Sokoto State's expectant mothers give birth at home with the aid of TBAs.

						Dr. Abubakar Maishanu, the USAID deputy chief of party, in a previous report, stated that only 4.7percent of women in the State give birth in a health facility. 
						A situation, he observed, which has worsened the incidence of maternal deaths in the state, adding that the likelihood of receiving assistance from skilled providers during delivery was low.

						"Only 17 percent of mothers received ante-natal care from a skilled provider," he said.

						Although these statistics are of Sokoto, it is hardly different from other parts of northern Nigeria.
